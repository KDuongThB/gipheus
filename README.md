# Gipheus

## Description

A website that displays trending GIFs from Giphy, allows user to search for GIFs and expand a GIF and see its details (username, rating, upload time) by clicking on the GIF's title.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.2.3, [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) version 18.19.1.

### Other functions I should add:

- Better search and GIF update animation
- Navigations
- Random GIF button
- Infinite Scrolling

## Development server

First, run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. 

Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
